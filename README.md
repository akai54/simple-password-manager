<div align="center">
Simple minimalistic password manager written in python.
</div>

## ðŸš€Motivation

This is actually a project assignment for the course [Introduction to Security](https://pablo.rauzy.name/teaching/is/).

## Features

- Passwords are stored in an encrypted SQLite database.
- Master key is used with a salt for more security.
- Possibility to create an unlimited number of entries.

## TODO

- Clear clipboard automatically.
- Automatically close if inactivity.
- Generate random passwords.
- Search for a specific entry.

## Usage

```python
python3 project.py
```

## Problems encountered

Adding the entries to a database wasn't a problem at all. I really struggled with finding a way to correctly,
encrypt and decrypt the database with any master key, at first I really tried going from scratch and implementing my own,
CBC encryption and decryption the same way we did in the course with the first assignment, The only problem was with the key,
the way it was implemented it would only encrypt and decrypt from a key in the form of a list containing 2 ints, and of course,
that can never be a encryption system for a password manager, not even for a prototype one. That is why I decided to use,
the Fernet encryption for this project, thanks to the cryptography lib. It is simple to implement and does the job correctly.
